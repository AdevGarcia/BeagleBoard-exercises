Here's how I copied the eMMC from on bone to another.

1.	Follow these instructions[1] to create an SD card that will boot
	and copy the eMMC to a .img file and compress it.
2.	On ubuntu I used the Disks command to format the CD to FAT.
3.	Once the .img.gz file was created on the Bone (it took some 30
	minutes), I ejected it from the Bone and mounted on the host and
	copied it to the host.
4.	I used etcher to uncompress and copy the image to another CD card.
5.	I checked the card by booting a Bone from it.
6.	Then edit /boot/uEnv.txt to make the CD flash the eMMC on another Bone.
